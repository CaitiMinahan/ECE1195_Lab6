# ECE1195_Lab6
Lab 6 project for Advance Digital Design class

Use Vivado High Level Synthesis (HLS) tool to create a hardware
accelerator for 2D image convolution.

Design the conv_hw function in the provided convolution.cpp template. You will be needing to watch the lecture recording along with this document in order to get the job done.
Synthesize the Top Function using both a ring buffer and a shift register for the line buffers.
Generate the Synthesis Report. You will be writing a report for this Lab so make sure to get screenshots that would cover all parts of the report.
Simulate the c testbench and have a look at the generated picture, the hw and sw generated pic should be matching. Those pictures will be included in the report as well.
Generate the ip for conv_hw and use the provided Vivado template to generate the bitstream.
